# RocketLaunchSimulator
Rocket Lauch Simmulator is my first, simple Python project.
Program was designed for collage subject, where I had to use engineering calculations. 
It is based on animated  matplotlib function drawing plot over the time by calculating velocity and acceleration of the rocket with using physical equations.
Informations about rocket such as mass, engines thrust or time of stages are based on Falcon F9 Full Thurst.
