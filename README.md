# RocketLaunchSimulator
Rocket Lauch Simmulator is my first, simple Python project.
<br />Program was designed for collage subject, where I had to use engineering calculations. 
<br />It is based on animated  matplotlib function drawing plot over the time by calculating velocity and acceleration of the rocket with using physical equations.
<br />Informations about rocket such as mass, engines thrust or time of stages are based on Falcon F9 Full Thurst.
