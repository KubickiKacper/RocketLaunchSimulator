# RocketLaunchSimulator
Rocket Lauch Simmulator is my first, simple Python project.
</br>Program was designed for collage subject, where I had to use engineering calculations. 
</br>It is based on animated  matplotlib function drawing plot over the time by calculating velocity and acceleration of the rocket with using physical equations.
</br>Informations about rocket such as mass, engines thrust or time of stages are based on Falcon F9 Full Thurst.
</br>To calculate velocity of the rocket I used Ideal Rocket Equation:
```
ΔV=Ve*ln(m0/mf)
ΔV - Velocity change
Ve - Equivalent exhaust velocity
m0 - Initial mass
mf - Final mass
```
</br>To calculate acceleration of the rocket I used Force Equation:
```
F=m*a -> a=F/m
a - Acceleration
F - Force of engines
m - Mass
```
